The Weather App offers several key features enhancing the user’s weather tracking experience. The main feature of this app is displaying the temperature of the user’s location. The weather information is displayed according to the user’s default location, through the interactive map, or simply searching for the city they desire when clicking the search icon. Another feature of the Weather App is its slide-out navigation panel which facilitates seamless access to the additional weather tools: the main page, the 7-day (weekly) weather page, and the credits/contact page. The app incorporates three APIs: Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API, and the Weather API. The Google Maps API is used to display the weather app centered around the user’s location input settings. The OpenWeatherMap API casts an overlay over the map depending on the precipitation data gathered ranging from blue to orange indicating the current weather condition. Lastly, the Weather API displays the 7-day weather forecast, found by clicking in the navigation menu, that displays the weather in the selected city over the next 7 days.

Here is a Quick Demo of Our App:
